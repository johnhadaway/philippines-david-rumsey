Note	Colored pictorial map in a series of Mem-o-Maps by John G. Drury of the 214th Ordnance Battalion US Government, produced for military personnel during the Second World War. Mem-O-Maps' purpose was as a souvenir map on which troops could keep trace of their ‘adventures’ and movements. The maps represent an important historical period and integrate pictorial and geographical elements in a unique way. The use of cartoons and familiar map shapes used to show the conditions and experiences that the troops must have faced in reality, also shows memorable spots, wildlife and banners "came in on good ship" and "departed on good ship". The legend encouraged service men to note where they “landed or anchored” and when, as well as where they stationed” while there. Includes a decorative compass rose. Relief shown pictorially.
