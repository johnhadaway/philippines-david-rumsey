Pub Note	Outline color. Title page and index in French; maps in Dutch. Goos (1616-1675) was one of the leading engravers of the age, producing work for everyone from the house of Visscher to John Speed. His father, Abraham, worked with Henricus Hondius. After the success of both Willem Blaeu and Jacob Colom's pilot-books in the early seventeenth century, a host of imitators appeared, who mainly reworked the information available in existing books. Like many of his contemporaries, Goos bought, borrowed, and copied from his colleagues, and neither the texts nor the charts in his atlas are unique products of his work, but rather derived from many sources. It is unlikely that this atlas was used at sea given its fine coloring and engraving. Instead, it was probably used on land by business people and those who could afford to have it in their libraries.
