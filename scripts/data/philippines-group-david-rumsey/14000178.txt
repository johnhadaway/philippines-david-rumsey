Cassini was both a painter and engraver who trained in Rome under Giambattista Piranesi (1720-1778). "Piranesi taught him the strict principles of Roman and Greek architecture, albeit that both Piranesi and Cassini utilized classical images in a Baroque style and context. Cassini's preparedness to contemplate a hybrid classical format - incorporating classical architecture and figures as fashionable forms - characterized a celestial glove he engraved in 1792. Cassini produced influential atlases, maps and globes at a time of major political upheaval in Europe. Many redrawn boundaries followed in the wake of the French Revolution and Napoleon's conquest. While Britain, Spain and France were engaged in worldwide imperial conflict, Cassini's views emerged, anticipating by over fifty years the insurrections in Italy in 1831 and 1848-49, as well as Cavour's advocacy at the Congress of Paris in 1856 of an "Italian State". The survival of some of Cassini's globes in Italian schools attests to his educational contribution to the emergence of Italian nationalism, if not to the great power campaigns and treaties that led to the creation of the Kingdom of Italy in 1859-60. Cassini's globes also provide insights into the ecclesiastical politics of Rome, and to successive military occupations of the Papal Sates - occupations that led to loss of sovereignty and the Law of Guarantees of 1871, passed by an Italian Parliament to safeguard the Pope in the Vatican". - Baldwin, Robert W.
