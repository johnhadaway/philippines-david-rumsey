Pub Note	An entertaining fanciful pictorial or cartoon atlas of the United States which includes a full color map and a page of historical and geographical text on each of the 48 states plus the Territories of Alaska, Hawaii, American Samoa and the Commonwealth of the Philippines, plus a map of the Caribbean showing Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands and the Panama Canal Zone as well as the rest of the Antilles. Numerous small drawings on the map of each state depict sights, people, activities, crops, animals, relief, populated places,etc. A product of the 1930s, it depicts stereotypical images of people, such as on the Tennessee map there are a Ku Klux Klan (KKK) member in white hood and robe with a pistol and a bucket of tar, and a black person dragging a sack of cotton. In addition to these sometimes offensive images, it also reflects the times in terms of what was important or noteworthy about each area of each state be it growing corn, raising mules, crabbing, racing horses, making movies, sailing, Native Americans, national parks, quilting, romance, volcanoes, whales, rain, gold, or big trees. Art by Ruth Taylor (1900-) who was educated at the Pratt Institute of Art; the Art Students League.
