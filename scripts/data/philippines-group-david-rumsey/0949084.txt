Pub Note	First issued in 1887, this atlas is the successor to John Arrowsmith's London Atlas of 1858 (Stanford acquired Arrowsmith's plates upon his death). The first issue of the second edition appeared in 1893, with updated second editions of 1896, 1898, and this 1901. The third edition was issued in 1904 (see our #949) and Phillips (mistakenly) shows the next and last edition as 1928--actually 1931 according to Herbert in Imago Mundi p. 120. This is a magnificent atlas, in full color lithography, certainly the premier atlas of its day. Relief shown by hachures.
