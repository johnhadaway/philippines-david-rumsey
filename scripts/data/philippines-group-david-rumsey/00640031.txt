Pub Note	The 1st ed., with a list of subscribers. Fordham lists eds. of 1808, 1811 (reissue of 1808, no maps changes other than the 1811 date appearing on some of the maps), 1819 (one third of the maps amended), 1824 (maps unchanged from 1819 except for the date), 1828 (same as 1824, except for date changes, with reissues in 1833, 1836 (Baskes), and 1844). This is a fine atlas, one of the best of its period, and a source for American mapmakers (Tanner directly copied the World and continental maps for his New American Atlas). Fordham: (The maps) "are finely engraved, with full details, showing especially the water-ways and roads, and hill-shading, and are usually coloured. The work is very clear and delicate and of a uniform character throughout." Maps are hand painted in outline color and bound in half leather brown boards with "Cary's Atlas. 1808" stamped in gilt on the new leather spine.
