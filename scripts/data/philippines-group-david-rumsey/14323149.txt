Pub Note	Geography rectified: or, a description of the world : in all its kingdoms … First edition of pocket world atlas by Robert Morden, published in London, 1680. Quarto. 20th-century full calf; spine in five compartments separated by raised bands. Blank first and last pages added later. Title page stamped: Ex Biblioteca Edmundi Duaci. Collation: 4° : [1], A⁴, a², B-Cc⁴, Cc², Aaa-Zzz⁴, [1] pages. Pagination: [1], 1-204, 241-418, [1]. Pages 205-240 appear to have been omitted; signatures discontinue here. No references to these pages appear elsewhere within the volume. Numerous pagination misprints throughout, and continuously from page 289 through the remainder of the volume. Atlas contains 65 maps, including two maps on page 322 - West Barbarie and East Barbarie - which the table of contents lists simply as Of Barbary. Maps show international and administrative political boundaries, cities, routes, topography, drainage, coastlines, islands and other features of regions around the world, such as the Great Wall of China (page 295) and the indigenous peoples of the Bermuda Islands (page 401). Maps include indexes, compass roses and bar scales, as well as latitudinal and longitudinal lines. Atlas also provides a dedication, note to the reader, advertisement for other maps and an introduction to geography, as well as lengthy accompanying text for each map. Robert Morden (1650-1793) was a British map and globe maker. Little is known about his early life, although he was most likely apprenticed to Joseph Moxon. By 1671, Morden was working from the Atlas on Cornhill, the same address out of which Moxon had previously worked. Most famous for his English county maps, his geography texts, and his wall maps, Modern entered into many partnerships during his career, usually to finance larger publishing projects. Provenance: Verso of back cover contains manuscript annotations possibly indicating that the atlas was in the possession of a French bookseller in 1968, who deemed the work "very rare."
