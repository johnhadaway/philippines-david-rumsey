Pub Note	Matthias Quad was a map publisher based in Cologne, Germany. but had lived and was trained in the Netherlands. His first atlas was Europae...Descriptio of 1592 with 38 maps, expanded to 50 maps in 1594. This was expanded again in 1600 to this Geographisch Handtbuch with 82 maps. These books were both smaller pocket atlases intended to be less expensive alternatives to the larger folio atlases of Ortelius, Mercator, and De Jode, which also provided the source maps for Quad's atlas maps. Quad embellished his maps with scenes, portraits and other illustrations that make them rather unique. The Geographisch Handtbuch was the first atlas originally written with German text. Quad also produced larger single sheet maps, including a map of Europe in the form of a Queen (1587) and city plans for the Braun and Hogenberg Civitates Orbis Terrarum. In 1608 Quad published a third atlas with 86 maps, Fasciculus Geographicus.
