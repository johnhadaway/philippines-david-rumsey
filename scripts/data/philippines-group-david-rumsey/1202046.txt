Reference	P3542a.
Pub Note	This atlas was used by Lucas, Morse (S.E.), and Cummings & Hilliard (and Worcester) as a source of non American maps. Tooley says the last edition was 1809 (there appear to be no differences other than the title page between the 1808 and 1809 editions); Phillips has 1807; Moreland mentions 1816 as a re-issue - this also was probably used by the Americans. We have seen an 1816 edition cut up by a dealer to sell the maps individually. Maps are hand painted in full color.
