Pub Note	French marine atlas of the eastern oceans, updated to 1810 using French admiralty charts to provide a full working atlas for officers navigating towards the east, with routes to the Red Sea, coasts of India, China, northern parts of Indonesia and South-East Asia. Atlas contains 69 maps, many double-page, bound in large nineteenth-century quarter calf and green papered boards, with "D'Apres - Hydrographie Francaise. 469 A 557", in gilt on spine. D'Apres de Mannevillette published the first edition of the Neptune Oriental in 1745, with 22 charts, as being superior to all previous maps of Southeast Asian coasts (Suarez p.238). Thirty years later, in 1775, he published a second edition, completely revised and greatly increased. This 1810 edition was published with 69 maps from three different sources: 46 maps derive from the 1775 edition of the Neptune Oriental; 6 maps are added from a separately published supplement of 1781; and 17 French admiralty charts are added, based chiefly on the work of d'Apres de Mannevillette, but many of them post dating his death and most of them updated with recent surveys and discoveries . This is the latest dated reference in the charts, suggesting a date of publication of around 1810. Despite their different sources, the maps are similar in appearance and printing, have the insignia of the Depot Generale de la Marine and some are priced at 1-3 francs. Most of the charts are engraved by De la Haye.
