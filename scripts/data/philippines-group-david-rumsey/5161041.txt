Pub Note	John Lothian was an Edinburgh geographer and publisher who issued atlases of Scotland and its counties from 1825 to 1835, and a General Atlas in 1834 (R. Baskes). Tooley and British Museum list and 1846 edition of this atlas, probably the first. This 1848 second edition is a late production for Lothian, engraved in the style of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge (SDUK), but lithographed, with considerably less detail. On first glance the maps appear to be derived or copied lithographically from other maps of the period, but no engraver credit is given and we can not find any source maps. The mountains and rivers plate is unusual - it is a schematic representation that is decidedly "modern" in style. Outline color.
