Date	1801
Country	[India, Cambodia, Philippines, Indonesia]
Series No	50
Type	Atlas Map
Reference	Espenhorst 1.4
Pub Note	Two largely complimentary volumes bound together and dated 1799 and 1801 respectively. Some maps have scales. Hand colored in outline with little terrestrial information other than relief in hachures, basic hydrography, and product symbols, (see page I for legend). Both volumes were accompanied by text books by Gaspari that were more statistical works than geographies (Espenhorst). Both the atlases and the texts are some of the earliest works published by Gaspari and the publisher, Industrie Comptoirs eventually became the Weimar Geographisches Institut. Several pages stamped, John Cooper Jr., presumably an owner.
