Pub Note	Stieler's Atlas is extraordinarily detailed. Close examination of the maps shows many features that one would expect to find only on much larger maps. This atlas was first published in 1817, with editions continuing well into the 20th century. It was one of the most comprehensive and best executed 19th century German atlases. In this edition, the maps are dated 1871-5; Phillips says this was issued in parts. 8 pages of text accompanies the index. Atlas is bound in half leather brown cloth covered boards with "Stieler's Hand Atlas" stamped in gilt on the front cover and spine. Maps are both hand painted and printed in full and outline color.
