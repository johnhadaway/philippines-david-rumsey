Collection	Rumsey Collection
Pub Note	Rare reissue of 1842 Greenleaf Universal Atlas. Many changes from the 1842 edition: Florida a State, Michigan entirely redrawn, Mexican War results on North American map, Mexico, Texas, Oregon changes to show 1846 boundary with Canada, Missionary stations listed on the Hemispheres, and many new railroads, counties, boundaries, etc. There are more changes between this edition and the 1842, than between the 1842 and Burr's 1836. Not in Karpinski, which is strange because Michigan is totally redrawn, not in Phillips or any other reference. There is also an 1849 edition (property of C.W.) that has similar maps except the Mexico map does not reflect the Mexican War boundary - probably he was running out of maps and this was at the bottom of the stack! Has the same Geography text in the rear, unchanged. The Wisconsin and Iowa map in this copy differs from an 1848 in Fitch Catalogue 48, #314, in having Mandan Dist. instead of Missouri Territory in the Fitch, making this copy probably later (the 1842 has Missouri Territory). Burr's name is no longer on the map of Illinois. Maps are in full color. Bound in half leather, floral patterned blue cloth covered boards with "The Universal Atlas" stamped in gold. Spine reads "Atlas". Marbled lining.
