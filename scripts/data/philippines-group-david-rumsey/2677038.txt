Pub Note	Rare atlas, also pub. by Wm. Faden & John Smith. Kirkwood engraved some of the maps for Thomson's General Atlas (Edinburgh, 1817), but we can find no record of this atlas in Phillips, Tooley, Jolly (1983-92) or anywhere else - except for a record of a sale in the Map Collector #42. Kirkwood used A. Arrowsmith's maps from Pinkerton's Geography as a base, and enlarged and filled in detail where he could. The result is striking: these maps are more than twice the size of Arrowsmith's and often carry considerably more detail. Outline color.
